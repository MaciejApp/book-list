# 📚 Book List 

This project is one of the tasks in the UK Department of Education funded Frontend Developer course I am taking part in. 

The task was to create a Book List app - using JavaScript. It is using sessionStorage to hold data, which will be deleted once browser tab is closed.
Requirements for app were option to add, option to edit and delete.
